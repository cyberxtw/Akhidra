# Akhidra ðŸŒŠ 
2022 Google Solution Challenge

### Purpose of our Akhidra project:
We are developing underwater machine system collecting mucilage and waste materials especially in sea depths.
Our goal is to protect aquatic life and trying to turn the mucilage we collect into biofuel.

We aim to produce an accessible and clean energy source by converting the waste materials we collect in to electricity.

We want to contribute to the goals we set to achieve with the machine system we have developed until 2030.
